Ticket Verse
Ticket Verse is an NFT-based ticketing system built on the Stellar blockchain. This project utilizes the Ezerone scaffold to provide a modern, decentralized approach to event ticket management. Each ticket is represented as an NFT, enabling secure, transparent, and fraud-resistant access control for events.

Features
NFT-based Tickets: All tickets are created and managed as non-fungible tokens on the Stellar blockchain.
Decentralized: Leverages the security and transparency of Stellar to prevent ticket fraud and duplication.
Easy Integration: Built on the Ezerone scaffold for rapid development and deployment.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive processes for both event organizers and attendees.
